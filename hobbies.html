  <h1>Computer games</h1>
  Ever since being a young boy, I've been obsessed with PC gaming. I used to wingman my dad playing Doom on our 486, and basically learned to read by reading the manuals big box games used to provide.

<p> Even now I battle furiously to keep up with the latest advances and found myself heavily invested in the MMORPG Eve Online. At times even designing websites and infrastructure to manage a group of people hundreds strong in game.
  <p> Ultimately this even led to me becoming an affiliate content creator on twitch.tv, and made a few bucks out of it to boot!</p>

<h1>Camping</h1>

<p> I did quite a bit of camping in my youth, the trips that stuck with me were "themed" trips I did with my Dad, like the Romans or the Industrial revolution (cool kid I know...) where we would visit lots of roman ruins or slate quarries.
<p>Mostly forgot about camping until I met my lovely wife Charlotte, who also loves the outdoors and travelling. We love nothing better than disappearing in our big beaten up frame tent and finding somewhere to dangle our fishing rods.

Its the taking part that counts.
